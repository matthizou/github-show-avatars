# Github Show Avatars

> Beware: You are going to see your colleagues' faces... even more."

This extension will display large avatar pictures in your pull requests and issues list in Github and Github Enterprise. Ideal to quickly identify who created a pull request in a second.
This extension goes further and enables you to overwrite certain avatars by your own, which can bring both fun and better readability in the pages where it is applied.
It can also display 2 avatars side-to-side, which is really helpful to signal the team that 2 people are taking care of an issue, or have paired together in the code of a pull request.
